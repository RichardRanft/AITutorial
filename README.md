NOTE: This set of scripts should work for T3D 3.0 and earlier.  Namespace changes in some files for 3.5 and later (scripts/server/player.cs - Armor to PlayerData - especially, maybe other places) break these scripts.

Torque 3D AI Tutorial scripts

In this repository I will be keeping all of my working scripts live so that any who are interested 
see what I'm doing as I experiment with T3D's AI system.  I'm only putting scripts on here because 
this is a simple tutorial I'm making, and because I'm curious as to how much I can do with just 
scripting.  I'm not looking to make anything to rival the UAISK (great kit) or any of the other 
products available, I'm just trying to get a reasonable AI in place that will work with a multiplayer 
RTS.
